## Installation

Install notiblocks trough pip

```bash
pip install notiblocks
```

And just import the module into your application

```python
import notiblocks
```

## Usage
Notiblocks uses `NBConfig` and `NBHandler` objects, which let you customize your logs by your needs. You can access them trough the module.

* **`NBConfig`**: Holds the information about how your logs will look. You can override the information trough the constructor, or through the setters. For further explanation check the [`docs`](/docs/documented/nbconfig.md).
* **NBHandler**: Wrapper class for the `NBConfig`, which provides the main functionalities as `success`, `fail`, `warn` and `log`. For further information check the [`docs`](/docs/documented/nbhandler.md).

Example:
```python
from notiblocks import NBConfig, NBHandler
    
nb_conf = NBConfig(
    success_sign_color="blue",
    time_sign_color="GrEEn",
    success_sign="SUCCESS",
    success_bracket_color="cyan",
    time_sign_stamp="DATE",
    bracket_style="round     ",
    warn_bracket_sign="square"
)

nb_handler = NBHandler(nb_conf)

print(nb_handler.success("Notiblocks is cool."))
print(nb_handler.fail("Notiblocks is still not in a finished state..."))
print(nb_handler.warn("You haven't smiled enough today :)"))
print(nb_handler.log("User {} accessed this page", page.user))
```
