## Reporting a Vulnerability

### First way
If you want to report a vulnerability in the application follow these steps:
1. Go to the `Issues` page
2. Choose a `Vulnerability` template
3. Describe the vulnerability, how to reproduce it and a system description, so we could reproduce it locally

### Second way
Contact directly the project maintainer by mail *(he would start the issue, and make your work much easier)* - `dvs_sec@proton.me`

After you have submitted your issue, our team would imediately react and find a way to fix it in the next version :)
